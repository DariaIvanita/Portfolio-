    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      
      Hi! I'm Daria Ivanita, a passionate designer and developer with a keen interest in creating impactful digital experiences. Currently, I am studying New Media Production and Design at SAIT, where I am honing my skills in graphic design, web development, and project management.
      
      Throughout my academic journey, I have participated in various projects, including organizing hackathons and designing business cards and posters that emphasize mental health awareness. These experiences have allowed me to collaborate with diverse teams and think creatively under pressure.
      
      I thrive on challenges and constantly seek opportunities to learn and grow in the tech industry. My goal is to combine my design skills and technical knowledge to develop solutions that not only look great but also provide excellent user experiences.
      
      In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new design trends, participating in coding challenges, and contributing to open-source projects. I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals, so feel free to reach out!
